# Scratch Implementation of CNN for Bangla Digit Recognition

### In this project, I implemented a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) from scratch using the LeNet architecture to recognize handwritten Bangla digits. Key components of the CNN, including convolution layers, fully connected layers, and cross-entropy loss, were manually developed without relying on deep learning frameworks.

### I calculated gradients for the loss function and implemented backpropagation to adjust the model weights. The delta values were propagated through the layers, ensuring efficient learning of patterns in the dataset. This hands-on implementation deepened my understanding of the mathematical foundations behind CNNs and backpropagation. 

### After training, I achieved a test accuracy of 0.92 and a test macro F1 score of 0.91, demonstrating the model's strong performance in recognizing Bangla digits. This hands-on project deepened my understanding of the mathematical foundations behind CNNs, backpropagation, and performance metrics in machine learning.
